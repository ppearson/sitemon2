Instructions for building Sitemon from source
---------------------------------------------

Sitemon builds under Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris and BSD.

Sitemon cannot be easily built under MS Visual C++ 6, due to the number of template size warnings (warning C4786)
that VC++ 6 stupidly throws out for no reason, which causes the build of the whole
thing to fail with a Fatal Error C1063 error.
